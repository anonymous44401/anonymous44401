# 👋 Hi, I’m anonymous44401... but most people call me Cameron.
🖥️ I primarily work in Python.

🖥️ I work on the [realtime-trains-py](https://www.github.com/realtime-trains-lang/realtime-trains-py) and [realtime-trains-go](https://www.github.com/realtime-trains-lang/realtime-trains-go) repositories.

🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, Java and Go.

⚡ Fun fact: I am a massive train nerd.
